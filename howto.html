      <p>
        In Wavelength/Taajuus, two teams compete in being at the same wavelength
        with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each round, one team gets a prompt with two opposite qualities (for
        example Good/Bad). The clue giver of a team (rotate this after each
        round) will then see a randomly generated target they want their team to
        land.
      </p>
      <p>
        After this, they&#39;ll give a clue to the other team (for example
        &quot;My dog&quot;) and their team then discusses and decides where does
        the clue land on the spectrum. Before revealing the target, the opposing
        team gets to guess if it&#39;s more to left or right.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the guess is withing colored range on the target, team gets 2-4
        points. If it's less than 4 points, the opposing teams gets 1 point if
        they were right.

      <ol>
        <li>Have some friends over (min. 6 to form two teams of 3)</li>
        <li>A host opens the game and shares the screen</li>
        <li>
          I recommend hiding the seed with the eye button unless you really
          trust your friends (anyone with access to seed can see the correct
          target).
        </li>
        <li>
          You can either input your own seed or press
          <code>New clue</code> button to generate a new seed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the copy button to share the seed URL to person who&#39;s the clue
          giver.
        </li>
        <li>Clue giver clicks Peek to see the target and gives a guess.</li>
        <li>
          Their team then discusses and tells host where to move the indicator.
        </li>
        <li>
          The other team then guesses if it&#39;s more to left or more to right.
        </li>
        <li>Host clicks Guess and points are shown.</li>
        <li>
          Add points to the right team manually and hit
          <code>New clue</code> for a new round.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat until everyone falls asleep or has to change their baby&#39;s
          diapers.
        </li>
